CRITICAL: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED - ALL ISSUES TOGETHER

You admitted you did not look at working code. This is UNACCEPTABLE.

You IGNORED requirements we gave you.
You IGNORED the actual code that was being used before.

ROOT CAUSE:
When Page 2 was deleted, you likely used OLD code from Page 5 instead of NEW code from Page 6. This explains multiple issues.

YOU MUST:
1. Read the requirements we gave you
2. Check the actual working code (production + old code)
3. Compare what you did vs what was required
4. Explain why you ignored requirements
5. Explain why you ignored working code

ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE TOGETHER:

1. Proximity API (401/400 errors)
   - Did you use old code that predates security changes?
   - Did you check production code to see how it works?
   - Why duplicate calls?

2. Report Name Extraction - IGNORED REQUIREMENTS
   - Extracting "TODAY Location Report" - COMPLETELY WRONG
   - Should be "FRASER COAST" from front page (per requirements)
   - You IGNORED the requirements we gave you
   - Did you check how old code extracted report names?
   - Did you read the requirements document?

3. File Naming
   - Saving as "null-null-Fraser Coast (12)-2026-01-25.pdf"
   - Should be "Fraser Coast - January - April 2026.pdf"
   - Did you check how old code handled file naming?

4. Google Sheets 50000 Character Error - CRITICAL
   - Same report worked with old code
   - New code doing something different
   - Did you check how old code handled Main Body content?
   - This is a REGRESSION - you broke something that worked
   - You MUST explain what old code did differently

5. Missing Fallback UI
   - No instructions when ChatGPT fails
   - Did you check how old code handled failures?

6. Field Validation
   - Investment Highlights not mandatory
   - Did you check old code validation?

7. PDF Shortcut
   - Not added to property folder
   - Did you check how old code did this?

WHAT YOU MUST DO:

1. READ THE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Read the plan document we gave you
   - Read the requirements we discussed
   - Explain why you ignored them

2. Check PRODUCTION code:
   - How does it work in production?
   - What does the working code look like?
   - Compare production vs your changes
   - Why didn't you check this before?

3. Check OLD code (before redesign):
   - What was on Page 5 (old code)?
   - What was on Page 6 (new code)?
   - Did you use old Page 5 code instead of new Page 6 code?
   - Why didn't you check working code?

4. Review ALL issues together:
   - Are they all caused by using old code?
   - Are they all caused by ignoring requirements?
   - What did old code do that worked?
   - What did you change that broke it?
   - What requirements did you ignore?

5. Document findings:
   - For EACH issue, explain:
     * What requirements said to do
     * What old code did (that worked)
     * What you did (that broke it)
     * Why you ignored requirements/working code
     * How to fix

6. Propose solutions:
   - Show code changes needed
   - Explain why it will work
   - Show it matches requirements
   - Show it matches working code pattern
   - DO NOT FIX YET - wait for approval

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use cached data - API must always be called
- NEVER skip API calls - Security requirement
- Learn from existing working code - don't assume

DO NOT ASSUME. CHECK ACTUAL CODE. LEARN FROM WHAT WORKS.

YOU IGNORED REQUIREMENTS. YOU IGNORED WORKING CODE. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

You must:
- Read requirements
- Check working code
- Explain why you ignored them
- Fix ALL issues together
- Show you understand what went wrong
