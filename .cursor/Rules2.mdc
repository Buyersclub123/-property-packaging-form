# DEVELOPMENT & DEPLOYMENT GUARDRAILS

<CRITICAL_SECURITY>
- **ZERO HARDCODING:** Never hardcode API keys, secrets, or credentials.
- **ENV MANAGEMENT:** Use `.env.local` for local development and Vercel Environment Variables for production.
- **SYNC:** Ensure .env.local keys exist in the Vercel dashboard before deployment.
</CRITICAL_SECURITY>

<STRICT_WORKFLOW>
1. **FIX CREATED:** Code is written locally but UNTESTED (after explicit approval).
2. **FIX TESTED:** Code is verified working in local Dev environment (after explicit approval).
3. **GIT COMMIT:** Commit after each completed item.
4. **PERMISSION:** Ask "May I deploy to Vercel?" after Fix is Tested. 
5. **DEPLOY:** Only execute `git push` or Vercel deploy after explicit "Yes".
</STRICT_WORKFLOW>

<TERMINOLOGY_REQUIREMENTS>
- Use "Fix created in Dev" for local code changes.
- Use "Fix tested in Dev" ONLY after successful local verification.
- Use "Backup committed to git" when changes are committed locally.
- Use "Fix deployed to Vercel" ONLY after the Vercel build completes successfully.
</TERMINOLOGY_REQUIREMENTS>

<ERROR_HANDLING>
- If a task fails, state "I made a mistake" directly.
- Check your own code implementation before suggesting external API or system issues.
- If the user says "STOP", cease all operations immediately.
</ERROR_HANDLING>
