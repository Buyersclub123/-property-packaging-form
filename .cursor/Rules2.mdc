CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW RULES - MUST FOLLOW STRICTLY

DEPLOYMENT COMMUNICATION - USE THESE EXACT TERMS:

"Fix created in Dev" = Code written locally, NOT tested, NOT deployed
"Fix tested in Dev" = Code tested locally and working
"Fix deployed to Vercel" = Code deployed to Vercel Production
"Vercel-only change" = Change made only in Vercel settings (environment variables, etc.)

WHEN TO USE THESE TERMS:
- Say "Fix created in Dev" when you write code locally
- Say "Fix tested in Dev" ONLY after you've tested it locally and it works
- Say "Fix deployed to Vercel" ONLY after deployment completes successfully
- NEVER say "Fix deployed" if you only pushed to Git
- NEVER ask user to test if you haven't deployed yet

TESTING BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
- ALWAYS test fixes in Dev BEFORE deploying to Vercel Production
- NEVER deploy untested code to Production
- If user asks you to test something - test it and report results immediately
- If test fails - tell user it failed, don't deploy broken code

GIT vs DEPLOYMENT:
- Git push = backup/tracking only, NOT deployment
- Git push does NOT deploy code to Vercel
- Deployment to Vercel requires explicit permission from user
- NEVER say code is "deployed" if you only pushed to Git

DEPLOYMENT PERMISSION:
- ALWAYS ask explicit permission before deploying to Vercel Production
- User must approve deployment before you do it
- If user says "deploy" - that's permission, proceed
- If user says "test in Dev first" - do that, don't deploy yet

MONITORING DEPLOYMENTS/RESTARTS:
- When restarting dev server - monitor the restart
- When deploying to Vercel - monitor the deployment
- Confirm deployment/restart completed successfully before telling user to test
- If deployment/restart fails - tell user immediately, don't ask them to test
- Check deployment status yourself - if you can't check, ask user to check

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
- NEVER hardcode API keys, credentials, or sensitive values
- ALWAYS use environment variables from .env.local (local) or Vercel (production)
- .env.local values must match Vercel environment variables
- If environment variable is missing - add it to both .env.local AND Vercel
- User handles adding values to .env.local (file is filtered)
- I handle adding values to Vercel via API or tell user exact steps

VERCEL ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
- Project name: property-packaging-form
- Team ID: HCICkgEtqpNH4cacsrTLXLC9
- Dashboard URL: https://vercel.com/team_HCICkgEtqpNH4cacsrTLXLC9/property-packaging-form
- GitHub repo: (check git remote for current repo)
- Required environment variables: Check .env.local for full list

COPY-PASTE RULE:
- If user mentions they should have copy-pasted something but you don't see it
- Immediately tell user you think they didn't provide what they said they would
- Don't spend time searching for it - just ask them directly
