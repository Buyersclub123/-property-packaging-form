You are analyzing a photo document generator feature for a property review system.

## THE REQUIREMENT

Generate a professional PDF document with property photos.

**User Workflow:**
1. User drags & drops photos from realestate.com.au (or other sources)
2. System collects photos
3. System generates a PDF with:
   - Property address as header (e.g., "5 Acacia St Point Vernon QLD 4655")
   - All photos laid out professionally
   - Saved to property's Google Drive folder

**Current Manual Process (to be automated):**
- User downloads photos → Pastes into Word → Adds header → Saves as PDF → Uploads to Drive

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

- Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- Server-side API routes available
- Google Drive API for storage
- Photos: Various sizes/formats (JPG, PNG, WebP), typically 2-5 MB each
- Typical: 5-10 photos, Max: 20-30 photos

## YOUR TASK

Analyze and recommend:

### 1. PDF Generation Library
Which library is best for Next.js?
- PDFKit, jsPDF, Puppeteer, pdf-lib, React-PDF, or others?
- Why? (Ease of use, image handling, performance, server-side compatibility)

### 2. Image Processing
How to handle various formats and sizes?
- Resize strategy (optimize file size, maintain aspect ratio)
- Library: Sharp, Jimp, Canvas API, or browser-side?

### 3. Layout Design
How to layout photos professionally?
- Photos per page? (Grid 2x2, 3x3, or single per page?)
- Page size (A4, Letter)
- Margins, spacing, header format

### 4. Implementation Workflow
Step-by-step process:
1. User uploads photos (drag & drop)
2. [Your steps]
3. PDF generated
4. Saved to Google Drive

### 5. Edge Cases
- Very large images
- Unsupported formats
- Too many photos
- PDF generation fails
- How to handle errors?

## DELIVERABLES

1. **Library Recommendations** (PDF + Image processing)
2. **Implementation Plan** (Workflow, API endpoints, architecture)
3. **Layout Design** (Photos per page, page size, header format)
4. **Edge Case Handling** (Validation, errors, user feedback)
5. **Pseudocode Examples** (Upload handler, PDF generation, image resizing)

## CRITICAL RULES

❌ DO NOT WRITE FULL CODE
✅ Provide pseudocode and conceptual examples
✅ Focus on architecture and approach
✅ Recommend specific libraries with clear reasoning
