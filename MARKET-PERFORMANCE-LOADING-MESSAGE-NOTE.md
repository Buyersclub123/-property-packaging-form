# Market Performance Loading Message - Make More Obvious

## Issue
The "Checking market performance data..." message is not obvious enough when the page loads.

## Current State
- Small blue text box with "Checking market performance data..."
- Easy to miss, not prominent enough

## Suggestions to Make More Obvious
1. **Larger/more prominent box** - Make it bigger, maybe with an icon
2. **Spinner/loading animation** - Add a loading spinner icon
3. **Centered or more visible placement** - Move it to a more prominent location
4. **Different color** - Use a more attention-grabbing color (maybe yellow/orange)
5. **Progress indicator** - Show a progress bar or percentage

## Status
**TODO**: Review and improve loading message visibility before form completion
