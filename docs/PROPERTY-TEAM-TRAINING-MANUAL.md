Reviews – Why we do them:

Property Reviews help us present hand-picked opportunities to our clients.

They're created and delivered via email — clear, simple, and strategy-aligned.

We use a few core tools and sources to build each review, and everyone includes:

- Reasons why this property
- Full address
- Google Map pin
- Property description
- Relevant overlays (zoning, flood, etc.)
- Purchase price
- Rental appraisal
- Nearby amenities + closest major city
- Market performance over the past 5 years
- Key investment highlights
- Attachments to support the review

⚠️ There are different templates for different types of properties being packaged. In this doc we cover the most common type.

Reviews – Sourcing a property to package:

Property Sourcing – Agent Dialogue & Due Diligence

## Overview

This training outlines real-world insights from Will's sourcing experience, highlighting key steps, practical examples, and red flags to look for when sourcing property, especially in hot or unfamiliar markets.

## Section 1: Initial Market Assessment

### Where to Focus

Start with growth markets like Perth, South Australia, Brisbane, Bundaberg, Gladstone. But always remember:

If something looks too good to be true – 8 out of 10 times, it is.

Know the market intimately. For example:

- Murray Bridge (SA): Watch for flood zones.
- Vic: Many properties are priced for auctions.
- Adelaide: Some listings underpriced—verify why.

### Red Flag Tactic

Ask yourself: "Compared to what we've bought here before, does this stack up?"

- Sellers fishing for offers? May indicate something is wrong.

Reviews – Sourcing a property to package:

🔵 Section 2: Case Study Examples

📝 Property Looks Good on Paper...
62 San Jacinta (WA)
Brick, reno'd, large block.
Asking: mid-600s. Agent suggested "late 6s".
BUT...
Satellite view: back boundary touches a petrol station.
Also on a main road → explains price.
✍️ Lesson: Always check satellite AND street view.

🔵 Infrastructure Watch
17 Savage St, Morwell (VIC)
Brick, solid block, water tank on rear land.
Water tanks usually sit on council-owned high ground (reservoir land).
Located on T-intersection, thoroughfare, opposite school.
⚠️ Investigate who owns the land behind.

📞 Noise Issues
250 Egerton Dr, Winter Valley (VIC)
Located behind a car wash with a dog wash.
Even with doors closed, noise leaks through.
Tenants dislike it → must price cheap + adjust rental estimates.

# Reviews – Sourcing a property to package:

## Section 3: Agent Conversations

### Mindset When Calling

Say less, ask more.

Use satellite view live on the call to ask sharp questions. It shows diligence and elevates your status with the agent.

### Tactics

"I'm just doing some early Due Diligence before presenting this to clients."

Call PMs in the area: Ask about street feel, demand, red flags.

Use emotional intelligence (EQ) and market logic (IQ).

## Section 4: Market Logic & Rational Investing

### Use RP Data and REA (realestate.com.au) to validate pricing

Always compare regional pricing vs metro:

"If this is $620k in a regional town, what does $620k get us 2 hours closer to a capital city?"

Example: Northam (WA)

Property: 63 Gairdner Street

Asking: $630k

Spec: 3/2/2, small block

We've built better for $500k in same suburb

✓ Tracking your comps: Never delete prior deals (new/established)—use for cross-checking.

Reviews – Sourcing a property to package:

📞 Section 5: Reading Between the Lines in Agent Calls

Example: 8 Bingham Cct, Thorhill (NSW)
Just listed. Agent says "top end of the range" with no buyer feedback yet.
Sat open coming → vendor likely waiting.

Smart Approach:
Ask about:
- Lease status
- Owner intention
- Prior rent (esp. for NDIS)

Note: If agent can't confirm NDIS rent, assume standard yield.

💡 The less you talk, the more the agent fills silence. Listen carefully.

➤ Section 6: Watch-Outs for NDIS Properties
NDIS = Not Always

Many NDIS listings now appear due to funding cuts.

NDIS homes should be:
- Accessible
- Close to hospitals
- Not remote

❌ Don't buy NDIS in the middle of nowhere.

✅ Ask detailed questions and confirm actual rent achieved, not just agent speculation.

# Reviews – Sourcing a property to package:

☑ Final Takeaways

- Always do a satellite + street view check.
- Ask: "What explains this price?"
- Don't rush. Red flags? Walk away.
- Use past Buyers Club purchases as your benchmark.
- Use EQ + IQ: emotional intelligence + sharp due diligence.
- Keep agent calls strategic. Less talk = more insights.

# ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – output – Other

## How to Check Defect Counts

If the tool's output does not include a count of Major/Minor defects:
In the same tool chat, type: Provide count
The tool will return the number of Major and Minor defects.
Manually cross-check the report to verify these counts are accurate.
This serves as an accuracy checkpoint before finalising the summary.

## Best Practice Review Checklist

- ☑ Did the output include all Major and Minor defects?
- ☑ Are instructions present for each defect?
- ☑ Are the correct trades referenced?
- ☑ Were the exception cases (Asbestos, Cracks, Water Damage) handled with the correct phrasing?

# ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – Omar walk-through

## Understanding Report Structure

### Typical Sections in a Report:

#### Opening Summary

**Scope and Limitations** – Outlines what's covered

#### Defect Summary

- Major Defects – Safety, utility loss, or significant cost
- Minor Defects – Less urgent, but may still be costly

#### Detailed Notes & Photos

**Overall Condition Rating** (Average, Below Average, etc.)

## How to Interpret Defects

### Major Defects

These must meet one or more of:

- Safety hazard
- High cost to rectify
- If left unresolved, will become a major issue (e.g. high moisture)

### Examples:

- Poor driveways (default to major, even if acceptable in older homes)
- High moisture readings near bathrooms
- Cracks rated Category 3–4 or showing wall deflection
- Termite damage inside property
- Significant roof space damage

### Minor Defects

Still important, may add up. Some costly repairs may still be labelled minor.

# ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – Omar walk-through

## Common Issues & How to Assess

### Cracks in Walls:

Category 0–2 (Minor hairline to <5mm) = Minor
Category 3–4 (5mm–15mm+) = Major
Deflection (walls leaning in/out) = Major

**Note:** Monitor over time; don't rely solely on width.

### Uneven Flooring:

**Older homes (timber on stumps):** Usually OK
**Modern homes (concrete slab):** Red flag
May be due to subsidence, water damage, termites

## Common Issues & How to Assess

### Moisture Readings:

**Localized (e.g. laundry wall):** Often manageable
**Widespread (multiple external walls):** Likely rising damp – expensive

**Inspectors** Use high powered torched on ceilings to detect past leaks from observing discolouration (people often perform fresh paint to create cover-ups)

### Roofing:

Cracked/missing tiles can cause ceiling bubbling
Internal staining may be only evidence – inspector can't always walk the roof

---

# ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – Omar walk-through

## Pest Inspection & Termite Risk

**Tests Conducted:**
- Moisture readings
- Timber tap testing
- Visual inspection

**Risk Factors:**
- **High moisture** = Termite attractor
- **Blocked roof/wall access** = "High Risk" by default
- **Vegetation against home** = Potential entry point
- **Firewood storage** = Flagged

## Walk-Away Red Flags

Do not proceed if any of the following are found:
- Untreated internal termite damage
- Major roof structure damage
- Widespread moisture across rooms
- Rising damp in homes <100 years old
- Extensive cracking with wall deflection

**Advice:** Always arrange termite treatment after settlement

---

# ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – Omar walk-through

## Building Type Considerations

### Property Type

- Brick Homes
- Lightweight Clad (timber frame)
- On Timber Stumps
- Asbestos (1950–1985)

### Key Risk

- Lower maintenance, lower termite risk
- Higher maintenance, higher termite risk
- Acceptable if maintained, risky without access
- OK if intact; problematic for reno/demolitions

## Ratings Breakdown (Final Page of Report)

- **Average** = Proceed
- **Average to Below Average** = Caution, especially long-term holding
- **Below Average** = Strong walk-away trigger
- **Above Average** = Ideal

## Talking to Inspectors

Call the actual inspector if clarification is needed – Omar can help interpret but won't know specifics
