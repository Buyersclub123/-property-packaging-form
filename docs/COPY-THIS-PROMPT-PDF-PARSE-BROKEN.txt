URGENT: pdf-parse is fundamentally broken in Next.js 14

We implemented your dynamic import solution and it WORKED to register the route (no more 404!), but now we're getting a different error:

ERROR:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\User\.cursor\extensions\property-review-system\form-app\test\data\05-versions-space.pdf'
    at Object.openSync (node:fs:561:18)
    at Object.readFileSync (node:fs:445:35)
    at eval (webpack-internal:///(rsc)/./node_modules/pdf-parse/index.js:16:25)
```

pdf-parse is trying to open a test file from its own package internals. This happens even with dynamic imports because the library itself has bad code.

OUR CODE:
```typescript
export async function extractPdfText(buffer: Buffer): Promise<string> {
  try {
    const pdf = (await import('pdf-parse')).default;
    const data = await pdf(buffer, { max: 3 });  // We're passing a Buffer!
    return data.text;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error extracting PDF text:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to extract text from PDF');
  }
}
```

We're passing a Buffer, not a file path, but pdf-parse is still trying to read a file from disk.

QUESTION:
What's the BEST alternative to pdf-parse that:
1. Works reliably in Next.js 14 App Router
2. Can extract text from a Buffer (we download PDFs from Google Drive)
3. Only needs first 2-3 pages
4. Actually works in production

OPTIONS YOU MENTIONED:
- pdfjs-dist (legacy build) - How exactly do we use this?
- unpdf - Is this stable?
- pdf-lib - You said "weak text extraction"?
- Something else?

PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. Your #1 recommended library
2. Exact installation command
3. Working code example for our use case (Buffer → text extraction)
4. Any gotchas

WE NEED THIS TO WORK. pdf-parse is clearly not the answer.
