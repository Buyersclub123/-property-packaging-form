# Purpose of the Reviews

## Reviews – Why we do them:

Property Reviews help us present hand-picked opportunities to our clients.

They're created and delivered via email — clear, simple, and strategy-aligned.

We use a few core tools and sources to build each review, and everyone includes:

- Reasons why this property
- Full address
- Google Map pin
- Property description
- Relevant overlays (zoning, flood, etc.)
- Purchase price
- Rental appraisal
- Nearby amenities + closest major city
- Market performance over the past 5 years
- Key investment highlights
- Attachments to support the review

⚠️ There are different templates for different types of properties being packaged. In this doc we cover the most common type.

# Sourcing

## Reviews – Sourcing a property to package:

### Property Sourcing – Agent Dialogue & Due Diligence

## Overview

This training outlines real-world insights from Will's sourcing experience, highlighting key steps, practical examples, and red flags to look for when sourcing property, especially in hot or unfamiliar markets.

## Section 1: Initial Market Assessment

### Where to Focus

Start with growth markets like Perth, South Australia, Brisbane, Bundaberg, Gladstone. But always remember:

**If something looks too good to be true – 8 out of 10 times, it is.**

Know the market intimately. For example:

- Murray Bridge (SA): Watch for flood zones.
- Vic: Many properties are priced for auctions.
- Adelaide: Some listings underpriced—verify why.

### Red Flag Tactic

Ask yourself: "Compared to what we've bought here before, does this stack up?"

- Sellers fishing for offers? May indicate something is wrong.

---

## Section 2: Case Study Examples

### Property Looks Good on Paper...

**62 San Jacinta (WA)**
- Brick, reno'd, large block.
- Asking: mid-600s. Agent suggested "late 6s".
- **BUT...**
- Satellite view: back boundary touches a petrol station.
- Also on a main road → explains price.
- ✍️ **Lesson:** Always check satellite AND street view.

### Infrastructure Watch

**17 Savage St, Morwell (VIC)**
- Brick, solid block, water tank on rear land.
- Water tanks usually sit on council-owned high ground (reservoir land).
- Located on T-intersection, thoroughfare, opposite school.
- ⚠️ **Investigate who owns the land behind.**

### Noise Issues

**250 Egerton Dr, Winter Valley (VIC)**
- Located behind a car wash with a dog wash.
- Even with doors closed, noise leaks through.
- Tenants dislike it → must price cheap + adjust rental estimates.

---

## Section 3: Agent Conversations

### Mindset When Calling

**Say less, ask more.**

Use satellite view live on the call to ask sharp questions. It shows diligence and elevates your status with the agent.

### Tactics

"I'm just doing some early Due Diligence before presenting this to clients."

Call PMs in the area: Ask about street feel, demand, red flags.

Use emotional intelligence (EQ) and market logic (IQ).

---

## Section 4: Market Logic & Rational Investing

### Use RP Data and REA (realestate.com.au) to validate pricing

Always compare regional pricing vs metro:

"If this is $620k in a regional town, what does $620k get us 2 hours closer to a capital city?"

**Example: Northam (WA)**
- Property: 63 Gairdner Street
- Asking: $630k
- Spec: 3/2/2, small block
- We've built better for $500k in same suburb

✓ **Tracking your comps:** Never delete prior deals (new/established)—use for cross-checking.

---

## Section 5: Reading Between the Lines in Agent Calls

**Example: 8 Bingham Cct, Thorhill (NSW)**
- Just listed. Agent says "top end of the range" with no buyer feedback yet.
- Sat open coming → vendor likely waiting.

**Smart Approach:**
Ask about:
- Lease status
- Owner intention
- Prior rent (esp. for NDIS)

**Note:** If agent can't confirm NDIS rent, assume standard yield.

💡 **The less you talk, the more the agent fills silence. Listen carefully.**

---

## Section 6: Watch-Outs for NDIS Properties

**NDIS = Not Always**

Many NDIS listings now appear due to funding cuts.

**NDIS homes should be:**
- Accessible
- Close to hospitals
- Not remote

❌ **Don't buy NDIS in the middle of nowhere.**

✅ **Ask detailed questions and confirm actual rent achieved, not just agent speculation.**

---

## Final Takeaways

- Always do a satellite + street view check.
- Ask: "What explains this price?"
- Don't rush. Red flags? Walk away.
- Use past Buyers Club purchases as your benchmark.
- Use EQ + IQ: emotional intelligence + sharp due diligence.
- Keep agent calls strategic. Less talk = more insights.

# Risk Overlays

## ChatGPT: Property Risk Overlays

**Purpose:** We use Stash.com.au to source data for Property Risk Overlays

| Property Overlays | Zoning:
Flood:
Bushfire:
Mining:
Other:
Special Infrastructure:
Due Diligence Acceptance: Y/N |
| --- | --- |

## Once completed

| Property Overlays | • Zoning: GR (General Residential)
• Flood: No
• Bushfire: No
• Mining: No
• Other: No
• Special Infrastructure: No

Due Diligence Acceptance: Yes |
| --- | --- |

### Process:

- Log in to https://stashproperty.com.au/ & enter the target property address
- Navigate to Planning Insights
- If the corresponding overlay to the template is green, enter a yes against the relevant bullet in the template.
- Some overlays are not listed here, and this information will need to come from the BA requesting the property to be packaged, or from analysis yourself.
- Click on the **View Planning Info link** & enter the Zoning information against the relevant template bullet point using the following formatting "Zoning: GA (General Residential)"
- Finally Edit the Due Diligences Acceptance line as shown in the example

# RP Data CMA Report Creation

## Reviews – RP Data CMS Report Creation

**Source Platform:** https://rpp.corelogic.com.au/

### Step 1: Locate the Property

Log into RP Data and enter the address of the property you're reviewing and hit enter.

Review the property details displayed on screen.

**Cross-check this information with:**
- The selling agent's details
- External sources like Stash, realestate.com.au, or other reference platforms

➤ This helps identify any discrepancies in layout, build year, land size, etc.

---

### Step 2: Generate Reports

Click the "Reports" button on the top menu (highlighted in green on the previous slide) and select one of the following two reports, follow the process, and comeback and do the 2nd report:

- **CMA Report** ➤ For identifying comparable property sales to support valuation.
- **Rental CMA Report** ➤ For identifying comparable rental properties to validate the rental estimate.

---

### Step 3: Refining the values

- **Adjust Filters:** Use the filter settings to fine-tune criteria (e.g., property type, distance, format etc).
- Click "Update Filters" to refresh the results.

Each report opens in a new browser tab:

---

### Step 4: Select Comparables

- Tick the checkbox on the top left of each relevant property.
- Selected properties will move to the "Selected Comparable Sales/Rentals" panel at the top.

The selected properties will move to the "Selected Comparable Sales/Rentals" panel near the top of the page.

---

### Step 5: Progress to generate your report

- Click Next, to the Comparable Listings page
- Click Next, to the Customise Report page

---

### Step 6: Review and Finalise Report

You'll see the report preview, including:
- A location map with target and selected properties.
- A list of comparisons with property-level detail.
- Additional suburb information.

**Important:** Only have the checkboxes ticked that are shown on this screen shot.

If you want to edit your selection, you can navigate back to the filter screen.

When satisfied, click Next again to generate the report.

---

### Step 7: Download and Save

- Download the final PDF report.
- The file name will include:
  - The report type & property address
  - A unique download identifier (e.g., -2025716)
- **Before saving, delete the identifier so your file name is clean and professional.**

---

# RP Data CMA Report Criteria

## Reviews – RP Data CMA Criteria

### 1. Property Filters

- **Property Type:** Comparable (add "Unit" for Duplex / Dual)
- **Sold within:** 6 months
- **Radius:** 2 km (extended incrementally first if no comps, over 5km for regional properties only)
- **Beds:** Comparable (extended if no comps)
- **Baths:** Comparable (extended if no comps)
- **Car:** Comparable (extended if no comps)
- **Land size:** Set 50 sq m. above initially & incrementally increase as needed.

Always compare floor plans with comps if available.

Look for opportunities i.e. additional beds and highlight to BA notes at top of email review

---

### 2. Comparable Selection

**Required:** If no comps, ok to add:
- 3x Sold / Rented
- 1x Superior
- 3x On-Market
- 1x Inferior

---

### 3. DUAL KEY PROPERTY CHALLENGES

- Often no exact comps available
- Valuers tend to ignore layout (dual key) and focus on internal floor space
- Thus, final bank valuation may fall short — prepare to justify through replacement cost or investment potential

---

### 4. RENTAL CMA GUIDANCE

**Key Points:**
- Beds are king, land size has minimal impact on rent
- If a rent seems off, explain the outlier (seasonality, road frontage, etc.)
- Don't force a false rent range — show the range naturally through superior/inferior examples
- Vacant: treat rent cautiously
- Be confident in your appraisal — don't let poor PMs drag down the pricing logic

**Remember Comments for BA as required for:**
- Superior/inferior comps explained
- RP Data errors checked
- Justify outliers for sales / rental
- Clarify why a certain price point is valid despite fewer sales
- Opportunities i.e. extra bed by repurposing another room

---

### Key Elements for Comparability

- Title type (e.g. Torrens)
- Construction type
- Land size
- Build/floor size
- Spec level (fixtures & finishes)
- Internal layout (especially for dual key)

This aligns with valuer methodology — you're reverse-engineering a valuer's logic.

**If nothing comparable – extend radius first before widening other criteria**

**Dual-key properties – caution – if no direct dual key comps exist, use floor size and replacement value instead. Ok to add unit to property type.**

**Duplex – Comparable single properties can be used. Ok to add unit to property type.**

---

### Notes:

- ☑ Double garage implies wider block; this influences value
- ☑ If on-market: do not present unless price visible and product comparable
- ☑ Avoid typos and tech-based assumptions – verify manually where possible
- ☑ Use REA and Stash to triangulate info; don't blindly trust any one source
- ☑ Avoid overstating — use realistic comps to prevent the "too good to be true" objection from clients.
- ☑ On a main road? Apply ~5% discount
- ☑ High-% owner-occupier suburb — resale driven by owner sentiment
- ☑ Coast proximity increases value; positioning within the suburb matters & should always be considered
- ☑ Be aware of agent miss-representing Car space

## Reviews – Email Template Formatting Tips

We use Gmail to send reviews, so formatting needs to be clean, consistent, and compatible.

### Paste as Plain Text

Always paste into Gmail as plain text (no formatting, fonts, or colours).
Right-click → "Paste without formatting" or use `Ctrl + Shift + V`

### Colons

Always include a space after each colon.
➤ e.g. `Price: $585,000` | ~~`Price:$585,000`~~

### Body Text Formatting

Use dash–space format to separate key lines.
➤ e.g. `Asking: On-market -$400,000 - $430,000`

Bedroom numbers in dialogue, hyphenate number and word
➤ e.g. `Comparable 4-bed properties have traded for…"`

### Highlighting Key Text

Use bold formatting to make important numbers or phrases stand out, along with indentation as directed.
➤ e.g.
'Total: $969,900 Net Price: $949,900 when considering the $20k cash' rebate'

This keeps key details easy to spot for both internal and client-facing emails.

### Avoid:
- • ALL CAPS (shouts at the reader)
- • Bright or 'danger' colours or highlight backgrounds
- • Italics for emphasis — less readable on mobile

### Abbreviations:
- • Full text should be used for months/ years and per week
- • ➤ e.g. `Expiry: September 2025'`
- • ➤ e.g. `Rent: $460 per week'`

# Why this property?

## Reviews – Filling in the "Why this property?" Section

This section gives a quick snapshot of why this property is investment-worthy — short, punchy bullet points that align with the Buyers Club strategy.

Whilst these points come from the ChatGPT tool called "Property Summary Details" —but you can adjust or add based on the property type.

For example, if it's a new build, you might add:
"Strong Depreciation"

**Goal:** Help the client instantly understand why this opportunity is worth their attention.

By also adding a screen shot of the property description into the ChatGPT when entering the address property specific bullets might also be given.

### Format Tip:

Paste as plain text or type manually.
Add one space after each colon (e.g. `Bed: 3`).
Then apply bullet points using the toolbar.

**NOTE:** This section is generated using the ChatGPT-based Property Summary Tool.
To learn how to access and use this tool, refer to the "ChatGPT Tools: Property Summary Tool" guide.

# Address & Google-map

## Reviews – Filling in the Address & Google Map Sections

These two fields are for sharing the full address and a clickable Google Maps pin drop.

### Address

Double-check spelling for accuracy.

**Formatting tip:** Paste this as plain text — no bullets needed for these fields.

### Google Map

This should be a live link that shows the property's exact location on Google Maps.

**How to edit the link text to show the address:**

1. Paste the Google Maps link into a Google Doc or Sheet
2. Copy the full address from your review template
3. Right-click the link → click Edit link
4. Replace the text label with the address (top box)

## Reviews – Property Description Exception Examples

### Example 1: Subject to Owners Corporation

**Property Description**
- Bed: 3
- Bath: 2
- Car: 1
- Built: 2024 approx.
- Land Size: 220 sqm approx.
- Title: Individual
- Subject to Owners Corporation - for Club Jubilee One

- Club Jubilee One: Australia's first private indoor water park, features include:
  - Indoor water slides
  - Large leisure pool
  - 25-metre lap pool
  - Junior Fun Zone
  - Fully equipped gymnasium

**Note:** Whilst this property has an Individual title, it also has an Owner Corp cost. This provides residents access to the Private Aqua Park & Gymnasium.
So indented below the Title, we state "Subject to Owners Corporation", with the standard "Body corp.:" indented below that using our standard format.
Below this we can provide additional information, indented from the Subject to Owners Corp sentence rather than the Related Cost sentence, with relevant bullet points to provide information, whilst avoiding sharing web addresses if we cannot control what the client will see if the click the link.
Check with BA before sending.

### Example 2: Granny Flat

**Property Description**

**Main House**
- Bed: 3
- Bath: 1

**Granny Flat**
- Bed: 1

---

## Reviews – Property Description Final Check

### Final Review Checks:

- Confirm title type via agent or contract of sale
- If available, use a floor plan to verify bed/bath/car layout etc.
- Beds must be allocated & legal-sized - we cannot repurpose a 2nd living room as an extra bed. But can highlight it to the BA as an opportunity
- Use "TBC" only if absolutely necessary - If key info such as "Body corp." is unavailable at the time of packaging, enter TBC. However, this should be avoided & wherever possible the Property Review not be sent until confirmed.

### Where can we source & check data:

- Selling agent
- Stash / RP Data / Property.com.au
- Ask the BA if there are discrepancies

**Format Tip:**
Paste as plain text or type manually.
Add one space after each colon (e.g. `Bed: 3`), then apply bullet points using the toolbar.

# Purchase Price

## Reviews – Purchase Price: Asking, Comparable & Acquisition Range

### Asking: – how the property is positioned in the market

**Definitions:**

- **On-market** –
  - The property is on market with ads on REA, Domain etc

- **Off-market** –
  - The property is not advertised on REA, Domain etc AND there is no plan by the agent to launch an online campaign

- **Pre-launch opportunity** –
  - The property is not advertised on REA, Domain etc BUT there is a plan by the agent to launch an online campaign in the future

- **Coming soon** –
  - We see this occasionally where the agents try to create awareness of a property coming to market soon or to gather price range interest

### Asking + Price range info:

- **On-market** –
  - Detail range as advertised
  - i.e. "Asking: On-market - $450,000 - $520,000"

- **Off-market** –
  - Inflate the range given by agent, ensuring it can be supported by comparable

- **Pre-launch opportunity** –
  - Detail range as expected to be advertised
  - i.e. "Asking: Pre-launch opportunity - $450,000 - $520,000"

- **Coming soon** –
  - Detail range as advertised

### Examples:

**Purchase Price**
- Asking: On-market - $475,000 - $480,000
- Comparable Sales: We have seen comparable properties trade into the high 400k's to low 500k's
- Accepted Acquisition Target: $450,000 - $470,000

---

## Comparable Sales & Acquisition Range

The comparable sales information is sourced via the online CMA reports from **CoreLogic - RP Data website**

### Wording:

It is essential we use common language associated with real estate, such as:

**Numeral's:**
When providing comparable ranges, we can say simplify by using a shortened number. See below highlights:
"Comparable properties are currently trading in the vicinity of mid 400k's to early 500k's"

**Note:** No Dollar Sign ($) is used | We use a shortened number | Utilising "k's" to indicate thousands

**Non or few true comparable properties:**
If the property type not often sold in the suburb, we can use wording such as:
"Similar properties are seldom traded. However, we have seen single family 3 bed homes selling in mid to high 300k's"

**Acquisition Range:** Must be a target that the property can be secured for, but also one that demonstrates value.
"Accepted Acquisition Target: $450,000 - $470,000"

Always give yourself a buffer, if we know we can purchase the property for $458,000, inflate the top range to $470,000

**Common Real Estate Terms:**
- Traded – "Traded recently for $1.2M"
- Sold – "Sold swiftly above expectations"
- Achieved – "Achieved a premium result"
- Fetched – "Fetched a record-breaking price"
- Secured – "The vendor secured a great outcome"
- Commanded – "The property commanded a strong price of..."

---

## Reviews – Purchase Price Examples

### Example 1: Off-market

**Purchase Price**
- Asking: Off-market - $490,000 - $520,000
- Comparable Sales: Comparable properties are currently trading in the vicinity of high 400k's to early 500k's
- Accepted Acquisition Target: $460,000 - $485,000

**Note:** This property is an Off-market (The property is not advertised on REA, Domain etc AND there is no plan by the agent to launch an online campaign) The agent provided a range of $460,000 - $490,000. We have inflated the Asking range (ensuring we can provide comparable's to support this) with the target acquisition range based on an achievable purchase price whilst still providing a buffer.

---

### Example 2: Pre-Launch

**Purchase Price**

# Rental Appraisal

## Reviews – Rental Appraisal – What to Include

Rental Appraisal includes six key fields — not all are necessarily required:

### Occupancy

Is the property Owner Occupied, Tenanted or Vacant?
- **Owner Occupied** = owner currently living in property.
- **Tenanted** = currently tenanted.
- **Vacant** = no one currently living in property.

### Current Rent – use "per week"

If tenanted, detail current rent, otherwise, delete.
➤ e.g. Current Rent: $450 per week

If dual-key: detail each side separately, see examples slides

### Current Yield – use the "~ " (circa symbol) + space in front of %

Delete if Vacant. Present as %, this is based on:
Current Rent & Highest Accepted Acquisition Target

### Expiry – use full month & year i.e. "October 2026"

If tenanted, detail when the lease ends (M/Y), otherwise delete.

### Appraisal – use the "~ " (circa symbol) + space in front of %

Add expected rental range based on CMA + market knowledge.
If dual income, separate by unit, see examples slides

### Appraised Yield

Presented as %, this is based on:
Highest rental appraisal & Highest Accepted Acquisition Target

### Example:

**Rental Assessment**
- Occupancy: Tenanted
- Current Rent: $450 per week
- Expiry: October 2025
- Current Yield: ~ 4.82%
- Appraisal: $460 - $480 per week
- Appraised Yield: ~ 5.14%

  - Unit A: $550 per week*
  - Unit B: $450 per week
- Expiry:
  - Unit A: September 2025
  - Unit B: January 2026
- Current Yield: 4.98%

- Appraised Yield: ~ 5.2%

* Note current yield is reflective of Unit B not currently tenanted.

---

### Notes for Dual Income Properties:

- For dual income properties: Keep the same structure but indent to show each Units detail
- If one side of a duplex is receiving significantly more rent than the other due to renovation, Asterix (*) the rent and make simple a comment at the bottom of the field. (see left box as an example), no reno costs, basic info is enough.
- If one side is not currently tenanted, detail Vacant as normal, then against Current Rent, Expiry detail "N/A"
- If one side is not currently tenanted, Asterix the yield and make a comment at the bottom of the field. (see right cell)

# Cashflow Spreadsheet Creation

## Reviews – Cashflow Spreadsheet Creation

### Cashflow Spreadsheet – Overview

When assessing a property, one of two spreadsheet templates is used depending on the contract structure:

- **Split Contract Properties** → CF H&L Spreadsheet Template 2025 vX.XX.xlsx
- **Single Contract Properties** → CF Spreadsheet Template 2025 vX.XX.xlsx

The next few Slides Covers the Single Contract version. The differences in the split contract version will be highlighted in subsequent slides.

Upon opening the spreadsheet, you'll see this dashboard-style layout with multiple sections clearly defined.

**Navigation Tip:** The spreadsheet includes multiple colour-coded tabs (e.g. Personal 90%, SMSF 100%, Custom). Input is typically done on the Personal 90% tab, unless an alternate strategy is being applied.

The following slides walk through each major section of the spreadsheet to explain what data to enter and where to find it.

---

## Reviews – Cashflow Spreadsheet Section 1

### Section 1 – Purchase Price

This is where you input the core details of the property purchase.

**Key Fields to Complete:**

- **Purchase Price** – Enter the total agreed price of the property.
- **Address** – Add the full property address, including street, suburb, state, and postcode.
- **State** – Select the state from the dropdown; this impacts government fees and stamp duty calculations.

**Pre-Filled or Rarely Changed Fields:**

Most of the remaining fields (e.g. loan amount %, deposit %, payment type, interest rate, management fee %, tax bracket) are set to standard defaults and generally do not need to be changed.

However, if these need to be changed for a specific clients needs prior to sending out the BA will make the necessary changes.

---

## Reviews – Cashflow Spreadsheet Section 2

### Section 2 – Funds Required

This section outlines the total funds the client needs to settle the property, factoring in all costs and potential rebates.

**Key Functions:**

- Most fields here are auto-calculated based on data entered in Section 1, including:
  - Loan Amount
  - Deposit Needed
  - Stamp Duty + Mortgage Reg & Transfer Fee (calculated automatically based on the purchase price and state)

**Manual Entry Fields:**

- **Legals** – Enter the solicitor/conveyancer cost. A default placeholder (e.g. $2,500) is used.
- **Buyers Club Fee** – Left blank, can be populated by the client should they wish.
- **Cash Rebate** – Enter any cashback the buyer will receive. This adjusts the Net Funds to reflect the true out-of-pocket cost.

**Note:** This highlighted cell is a dropdown field to select the report type required:
- For new builds, select PCI (Pre-Completion Inspection)
- For established homes, select P&B (Pest & Building Report)

This ensures the correct cost is automatically reflected in cell to the right and becomes part of the cashflow and settlement financial planning.

---

## Reviews – Cashflow Spreadsheet Section 3

### Section 3 – Expenses

This section outlines the ongoing holding costs associated with the property.

**Key Elements:**

- **Repayments** – These are automatically calculated based on:
  - Loan amount
  - Interest rate
  - Loan type (Interest Only vs Principal & Interest)
- **Management Fees** – Automatically derived from the rental income and the management fee % set in Section 1.
- **Council/Water Rates & Insurance Values** – Whilst the Council Rates and Insurance amounts are defaulted to the set amounts, consideration should be given to these and adjusted with appropriate amounts.
- **SMSF Contributions** – This field is not edited on the font sheet, this will be covered in subsequent slides.

**Note:** Insurance Cell – This is a dropdown field allowing you to select between:
- Insurance
- Insurance + Strata (used for townhouses, apartments, or any property with a body corporate fee)

---

## Reviews – Cashflow Spreadsheet Section 4 + Depreciation

### Section 4 – Estimated Market Rent + Depreciation

This section outlines the expected rental income range and the estimated tax benefits derived from depreciation.

### Rental Appraisal

You must enter Low, Medium, and High rent estimates for the property.
These figures will have been derived from market knowledge and or via the RP Data (Direct Comparison) Report. This range gives

### Depreciation

The Estimated Depreciation (Yr 1) field captures the first-year depreciation amount claimable by the investor.

See references on how to ascertain this figure.

**Caution:** When entering the Depreciation figure, this it needs to be entered as a minus figure, so with minus '-' symbol in front of the $ Value.
➤ e.g. '-$17,000'

If there is no claimable depreciation enter "0" as this demonstrates it has been considered.

---

## Reviews – Cashflow Spreadsheet Final Steps and checks

### Adjusting SMSF Contributions

After completing the rest of the spreadsheet, the final task is to navigate to each SMSF-specific tabs.

In the SMSF Contributions field, we need to demonstrate the monthly contributions required to support the property if there is negative cashflow.

To do this, simply enter the monthly numerical value shown in the "Lower Rent (as is)" cell of Section 6 and add $1. This will have the effect of showing the minimum rent as just above neutrally geared.

### Final Review & Presentation

Perform a full check of all fields to ensure:
- Data has been entered accurately and not fields missed.

Finally, return the spreadsheet view to the first tab and scroll to the top-left corner. This ensures that when the client opens the file, they see a clean and professional landing view.

**NOTE:** We can see from the below that the property is cashflow negative after tax benefits.

**NOTE:** By trial and error of entering different values in the contributions cell, we need to get the post-tax cashflow to be $0 or $1.

---

## ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – output – Major & Minor

### Defect Categorisation Logic

The tool automatically categorises defects based on the structure used in the original report.

While many reports use terms like Major or Minor, others may use alternatives such as:
- Significant
- Severe
- Non-major

We've trained the tool to recognise these synonyms, but users should remain attentive to inconsistencies.

**Tip:** If the report uses unique or unfamiliar terminology, manually confirm the alignment of defect severity classifications.

---

### Instructional Wording for Each Defect

The tool appends repair instructions to each defect automatically. These instructions are linked to the appropriate licensed trade needed to perform the work. This ensures clarity and actionability.

### Exceptions – Handled Differently

The following defect types receive specific wording:

**Asbestos / Fibrous Cement Sheeting**
The tool will return the exact wording used in the report — no appended instruction.

**Cracks to Internal or External Walls**
The tool will append wording such as the below:
"Engage a qualified structural engineer to assess and determine the cost of rectification."

**Evidence of Water Damage**
The tool will append wording such as the below:
"Engage a qualified plumber to identify and rectify the source of the water ingress."

### Build & Pest Report: "Other" Sections – Explanation & Use

This section is designed to capture additional insights from the report that may not appear under the standard defect classification.

These fields provide a comprehensive understanding of non-critical issues, pest observations, and inspector commentary that may still influence the purchase decision or negotiation process.

### Notes: Termites

Pulls in any termite-related findings directly from the Pest Report.

Common examples include:
- Presence or absence of live termites or nests
- Durable notice identification
- Recommendations for post-settlement termite barrier installation

### Other Observations

Includes commentary that falls outside major/minor defect classification. This is aimed at ensuring the reviewer is aware of everything mentioned in the report.

### Inspector Comments

Direct verbatim quotes from inspectors are copied here.
Usually reference:
- Overall defect incidence rating (e.g. HIGH, MODERATE)
- Risk to inaccessible areas (e.g. likelihood of undetected termite activity)

### Next Step

This line is automatically generated by the ChatGPT tool.
It communicates the action we've taken with the selling agent/vendor, ensuring transparency for our client.

Standard wording:
"We will request the vendor to address the items within the Summary of Items."

Always retain this line to confirm due diligence has been followed on behalf of the client.

### Final Checks Before Sending the Build & Pest Email(s)

Once the ChatGPT-generated output has been pasted into the email body, review and verify the following before sending:

1. **Ensure Full Coverage of Defects**
   - Check that all defects listed in the actual Build & Pest report have been captured in the tool output.
   - If anything appears to be missing, manually extract from the report and include.

2. **Verify Defect Counts**
   - If the tool did not automatically include a count of Major and Minor defects:
     - In the same ChatGPT tool chat, type: Provide count
     - The tool will respond with a breakdown of Major and Minor defects.
     - Manually cross-check this count against the report to ensure it is correct.

3. **Confirm Instructional Wording** the tool has appended to each defect:
   ➤ e.g.
   - which trade is needed.
   - Asbestos/Fibrous Cement – must use exact report wording.
   - Cracks – must mention structural engineer assessment.
   - Water Damage – must mention qualified plumber engagement as well as the trade to rectify the damage caused.

4. **Review Additional Sections**
   - Other Observations: Delete this section if not relevant to the report.
   - Remove any other sections or content that is not meaningful or helpful to the client.

5. **Consider the contents of the report to identify your recommendation(s).**
   - See next slide for considerations:

# Build & Pest walkthrough with Omar, our B&P partner in SA

## ChatGPT: Build & Pest Tool – Omar walk-through

### Understanding Report Structure

#### Typical Sections in a Report:

**Opening Summary**
- Scope and Limitations – Outlines what's covered

**Defect Summary**
- Major Defects – Safety, utility loss, or significant cost
- Minor Defects – Less urgent, but may still be costly

**Detailed Notes & Photos**

**Overall Condition Rating** (Average, Below Average, etc.)

---

## How to Interpret Defects

### Major Defects

These must meet one or more of:
- Safety hazard
- High cost to rectify
- If left unresolved, will become a major issue (e.g. high moisture)

### Examples:

- Poor driveways (default to major, even if acceptable in older homes)
- High moisture readings near bathrooms
- Cracks rated Category 3–4 or showing wall deflection
- Termite damage inside property
- Significant roof space damage

### Minor Defects

Still important, may add up. Some costly repairs may still be labelled minor.

---

## Common Issues & How to Assess

### Cracks in Walls:

- **Category 0–2** (Minor hairline to <5mm) = Minor
- **Category 3–4** (5mm–15mm+) = Major
- **Deflection** (walls leaning in/out) = Major

**Note:** Monitor over time; don't rely solely on width.

### Uneven Flooring:

- **Older homes (timber on stumps):** Usually OK
- **Modern homes (concrete slab):** Red flag
- May be due to subsidence, water damage, termites

---

## Common Issues & How to Assess

### Moisture Readings:

- **Localized (e.g. laundry wall):** Often manageable
- **Widespread (multiple external walls):** Likely rising damp – expensive

**Inspectors** Use high powered torched on ceilings to detect past leaks from observing discolouration (people often perform fresh paint to create cover-ups)

### Roofing:

Cracked/missing tiles can cause ceiling bubbling
Internal staining may be only evidence – inspector can't always walk the roof

---

## Pest Inspection & Termite Risk

**Tests Conducted:**
- Moisture readings
- Timber tap testing
- Visual inspection

**Risk Factors:**
- **High moisture** = Termite attractor
- **Blocked roof/wall access** = "High Risk" by default
- **Vegetation against home** = Potential entry point
- **Firewood storage** = Flagged

**Advice:** Always arrange termite treatment after settlement

---

## Walk-Away Red Flags

Do not proceed if any of the following are found:
- Untreated internal termite damage
- Major roof structure damage
- Widespread moisture across rooms
- Rising damp in homes <100 years old
- Extensive cracking with wall deflection

---

## Building Type Considerations

| Property Type | Key Risk |
|--------------|----------|
| Brick Homes | Lower maintenance, lower termite risk |
| Lightweight Clad (timber frame) | Higher maintenance, higher termite risk |
| On Timber Stumps | Acceptable if maintained, risky without access |
| Asbestos (1950–1985) | OK if intact; problematic for reno/demolitions |

---

## Ratings Breakdown (Final Page of Report)

- **Average** = Proceed
- **Average to Below Average** = Caution, especially long-term holding
- **Below Average** = Strong walk-away trigger
- **Above Average** = Ideal

---

## Talking to Inspectors

Call the actual inspector if clarification is needed – Omar can help interpret but won't know specifics
