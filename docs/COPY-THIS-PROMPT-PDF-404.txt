PROBLEM: Next.js 14 App Router - API route returns 404 despite file existing and compiling successfully

CONTEXT:
- Next.js 14.2.35 with App Router
- Route file: src/app/api/investment-highlights/extract-metadata/route.ts
- The route uses pdf-parse library to extract text from PDFs
- Route compiles successfully (logs show "✓ Compiled /api/investment-highlights/extract-metadata in 2.8s")
- BUT returns 404 at runtime
- We believe Next.js is silently dropping the route from manifest due to pdf-parse's dynamic requires/native addons

WHAT WE'VE TRIED:
✅ Added export const runtime = 'nodejs' - Still 404
✅ Restarted server multiple times - Still 404  
✅ Cleared .next cache - Still 404
✅ Tried --experimental-old-dev (Webpack) - Still 404
✅ Created minimal test route - Works (proves routing is functional)
✅ Incremental testing - Confirmed pdf-parse import is the culprit

EVIDENCE:
Terminal shows: "✓ Compiled /api/investment-highlights/extract-metadata in 2.8s (1538 modules)"
Then: "POST /api/investment-highlights/extract-metadata 404 in 3922ms"

Browser console: "POST http://localhost:3001/api/investment-highlights/extract-metadata 404 (Not Found)"
Returns HTML error page, causing: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"

THE ROUTE CODE:
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import { extractPdfText, extractMetadataFromText } from '@/lib/pdfExtractor';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Downloads PDF from Google Drive
  // Extracts text using pdf-parse
  // Returns metadata
}
```

THE PDF EXTRACTOR:
```typescript
import pdf from 'pdf-parse';

export async function extractPdfText(buffer: Buffer): Promise<string> {
  const data = await pdf(buffer);
  return data.text;
}
```

QUESTIONS:
1. Is pdf-parse incompatible with Next.js 14 App Router's static analysis?
2. What PDF libraries work well with Next.js 14 App Router? (We tried pdfjs-dist and react-pdf, both failed with "Object.defineProperty called on non-object")
3. Would dynamic import work? `const pdf = (await import('pdf-parse')).default;`
4. Should we move PDF extraction to a separate serverless function/microservice?
5. Can we configure webpack to handle pdf-parse properly?
6. What's the recommended approach for PDF processing in Next.js 14 in 2026?

CONSTRAINTS:
- Need to extract text from PDFs in Google Drive
- PDFs are 20-50 pages, we only need first 2-3 pages
- Must work in Next.js 14 App Router
- Prefer server-side processing
- Want to avoid excessive complexity

PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. Root cause analysis
2. Recommended solution with pros/cons
3. Implementation steps
4. Code examples

NOTE: We have another route /api/investment-highlights/organize-pdf that also uses pdf-parse and WORKS. Not sure why that one works and this one doesn't.
