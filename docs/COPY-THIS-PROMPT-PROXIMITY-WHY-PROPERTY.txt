I have a Next.js 14 form with multiple steps. Two critical issues:

ISSUE 1: Proximity field is clearing "Why This Property" data
- When Proximity field calculates (Step 6), it clears the "Why This Property" field
- Both fields are on the same page (Step 6: Proximity & Content)
- They should be independent - Proximity should NOT affect Why This Property

ISSUE 2: Need to start processing Proximity & Why This Property earlier
- Currently both process when user reaches Step 6
- Want them to start processing in background after Step 1 (like Investment Highlights does)
- By the time user reaches Step 6, both should be ready

CURRENT WORKFLOW:
Step 0: Address & Risk
Step 1: Property Details
Step 2: Investment Highlights Check (uploads PDF, processes in background)
Step 3-5: Other fields
Step 6: Proximity & Content (currently processes here - TOO LATE!)

DESIRED WORKFLOW:
Step 0: Address & Risk
Step 1: Property Details → TRIGGER background processing for Proximity & Why This Property
Step 2: Investment Highlights Check
Step 3-5: Other fields (while Proximity & Why This Property process in background)
Step 6: Proximity & Content → Data already ready!

RELEVANT CODE STRUCTURE:

Form State (types/form.ts):
```typescript
export interface EarlyProcessingState {
  investmentHighlights: {
    status: 'idle' | 'checking' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error';
    data: { ... } | null;
  };
  proximity: {
    status: 'idle' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error';
    data: string | null;
  };
  whyThisProperty: {
    status: 'idle' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error';
    data: string | null;
  };
}
```

Proximity Field Component (ProximityField.tsx):
- Calculates proximity to amenities using Geoapify API
- Takes address from form state
- Currently runs useEffect when component mounts (Step 6)

Why This Property Field Component (WhyThisPropertyField.tsx):
- Generates 7 investment reasons using ChatGPT API
- Takes suburb and LGA from form state
- Currently runs useEffect when component mounts (Step 6)

QUESTIONS FOR PLANNING:

1. Why is Proximity clearing Why This Property data?
   - Is there a shared state issue?
   - Is one field's onChange affecting the other?
   - Is the form state being reset incorrectly?

2. Where should we trigger early processing?
   - In Step1 (Property Details) component when user clicks "Next"?
   - In MultiStepForm when transitioning from Step 1 to Step 2?
   - Create a new Step1B component (like Step1A for Investment Highlights)?

3. How to handle the async processing?
   - Call API endpoints directly from Step1?
   - Use the existing earlyProcessing state pattern?
   - How to handle errors if processing fails?

4. What data do we need to start processing?
   - Proximity needs: full address (street, suburb, state, postcode)
   - Why This Property needs: suburb, LGA
   - Both available after Step 1 (Property Details)

5. Should we show progress indicators?
   - Like Investment Highlights shows "Processing..." on Step 2?
   - Or silent background processing?

PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. Root cause analysis for Issue 1 (data clearing)
2. Step-by-step implementation plan for Issue 2 (early processing)
3. Code changes needed (which files, which functions)
4. Any potential pitfalls or edge cases
5. Testing strategy

PRIORITY: Function over formatting - need this working ASAP!
