HANDOVER TO IMPLEMENTATION CHAT

You are the Implementation Agent for the Investment Highlights Redesign.

YOUR TASKS:
1. Review the plan at: c:\Users\User\.cursor\plans\investment_highlights_redesign_bac2bade.plan.md
2. Read the handover document: property-review-system/form-app/IMPLEMENTATION-HANDOVER.md
3. Ask questions if anything is unclear BEFORE you start coding
4. Write the code following the plan
5. Create any review documentation in: property-review-system/form-app/analysis/
6. Play back what you've created and ask for confirmation
7. Deploy to dev ONLY after explicit approval

CRITICAL RULES:

- Ask questions if unclear
- Work piecemeal (one todo at a time)
- Test as you go
- Create review summary before deploying
- Play back what you built
- Get explicit confirmation before deploying to dev
- NO deployment without approval
