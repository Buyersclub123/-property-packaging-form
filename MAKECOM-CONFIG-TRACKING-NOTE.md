# Make.com Config Tracking - TODO

**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Status:** To be discussed

## Question

User mentioned they have an idea for tracking config settings in Make.com. Need to discuss:
- How to track Make.com configuration changes (webhooks, module settings, routing rules)
- What approach the user has in mind
- How this integrates with git workflow

## Context

- Git tracks files in the repository (code, docs)
- Git cannot track Make.com UI configuration changes (stored in Make.com's system)
- User has a potential solution/approach to discuss

---

**Note:** Remember to ask user about this during a future session.
