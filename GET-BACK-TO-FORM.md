# How to Get Back to the Form

## Quick Answer

**Just go to:** http://localhost:3000

## If the Server Stopped

If the page doesn't load, the dev server might have stopped. Start it again:

### Option 1: Check Terminal
Look at your terminal/command prompt where you ran `npm run dev`. If it's still running, you should see:
```
▲ Next.js 14.x.x
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Restart Server

Open a new terminal and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\User\.cursor\extensions\property-review-system\form-app
npm run dev
```

Then go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## Your Form Data is Saved!

**Good news:** Your form data is saved in browser localStorage, so when you go back to the form:
- ✅ Your selections will still be there
- ✅ You'll be on the same step
- ✅ All entered data is preserved

## Quick Tips

1. **Bookmark:** Bookmark http://localhost:3000 for easy access
2. **New Tab:** Open links in a new tab (right-click → "Open in new tab") so you don't lose the form
3. **Back Button:** You can use browser back button to return to the form

## If You Lost Data

If for some reason the data is gone:
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Check if localStorage is enabled
- Try refreshing the page (F5)
