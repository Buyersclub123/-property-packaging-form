COMPREHENSIVE CODE REVIEW REQUIRED

CONTEXT:
- Pages were moved around (Step1A removed, steps renumbered)
- Investment Highlights moved from Page 2 to Page 6

WHAT WE NEED:

1. Review working code (before last deployment to dev):
   - What was working in production?
   - What was working in dev?
   - How did things work before?

2. Identify what broke:
   - Compare working code vs current code
   - What changed that broke things?
   - Why did it break?

3. Identify unused/old code:
   - Code that hasn't been used recently
   - Old code paths no longer needed
   - Dead code that can be removed
   - Code from deleted pages still referenced

4. Provide recommendations:
   - What to restore
   - What to fix
   - What to delete
   - What to update
