CRITICAL: Proximity API Broken - Analysis Required

Proximity API is failing (401, 400 errors). This was working before the redesign.

ISSUES:
1. Line 863 (MultiStepForm.tsx) - early processing call missing userEmail
2. API call flow changed - causing duplicate calls and failures

QUESTIONS:
- Did you change proximity code? (It wasn't in the plan)
- What was the old code doing that worked?
- What did you change that broke it?

ACTION REQUIRED - REVIEW ISSUES 1, 2 & 3 TOGETHER:

1. Security context: Email required for API (security change made earlier)
2. Possible root cause: When Page 2 deleted, did you use old code from Page 5 instead of new code on Page 6?
3. Compare old code vs new code - did you copy old code that doesn't include userEmail?
4. Check production code - how does it work there?
5. Identify what broke
6. Document your findings
7. Propose solution (with code changes)
8. DO NOT FIX YET - wait for review and approval

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use cached data - API must always be called
- NEVER skip API calls - Security requirement
- Proximity is address-specific - Cannot reuse data
