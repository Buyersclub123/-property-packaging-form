REVIEW AND NEXT STEPS

Good work on completing the implementation. Here's what to do next:

1. CREATE REVIEW DOCUMENT
   - Location: property-review-system/form-app/analysis/implementation-review.md
   - Include: Summary of changes, files modified, deviations from plan, testing checklist, known issues, deployment readiness
   - This will be reviewed by the planning chat before deployment approval

2. STEP1A FILE CLEANUP
   - File deletion was blocked (optional cleanup)
   - Decision: Comment out the import in MultiStepForm.tsx (line 8) and keep the file for now
   - We can delete it later if everything works
   - Action: Comment out the Step1AInvestmentHighlightsCheck import

3. READ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
   - Full instructions saved at: property-review-system/form-app/REVIEW-AND-DEPLOY-INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - Includes: Where to save review doc, Step1A decision, deployment steps (server restart, cache clearing)

4. WAIT FOR APPROVAL BEFORE DEPLOYING
   - After creating review document, wait for review and approval
   - Do NOT deploy to dev until explicitly approved
   - When approved, follow deployment steps in REVIEW-AND-DEPLOY-INSTRUCTIONS.md
   - User cannot test until code is deployed to dev
   - Deploy first, then user will test
